<h4 class='text'>   	Going to the turtle rescue could be said as the best experience you can have. Mr.Firestein, Mrs.Firestein, Jack Firestein and Sebastian Hsu-Kwan are the ones who attended from troop 485.
  <br>   What we did was, we baited in the turtles, then the adults would pick them up with nets. We caught about 40 that day. Half of them were caught by us.
  <br>We were catching the turtles because the turtles pond was getting infected by the mud from the fire. <br>
  It is very sad that many litter in the pond. So one turtle had a fishing hook in itâ€™s cheek. This shows us that the woolsey fire has affected many of us. We are very happy we can help our community.
