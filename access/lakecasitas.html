      <span class="description-span">Boy scouts have always been known for their outdoor activities such as camping and hiking. So whenever troop 485 goes on a camping trip, many people jump on the chance to go live in nature for a few days. So we all left Friday night with all our camping gear in the cars, and as a tradition, stopped on the way for some grub. This time it was Panda Express and  we had a great time eating and catching up with one another. But, we had to leave so there was time to set up our tents. Luckily, Camping 101 taught the scouts how to put up the tents, so it only took a couple of minutes. That night we had the Flaming Squirrels light the campfire to help satisfy their fireman's chit requirements. After an hour of relaxing near the campfire, it was brushing teeth and getting ready for bed.</span>
      <span class="description-span">The next day, all the scouts rose to the warm sunshine and the birds chirped. We all started unpacking the stoves and made some pancakes for breakfast. After that, we made a flag pole to honor 9/11.   fUsually at this time we would prepare for a bike ride, but the weather was too hot and we just ended up teaching the younger scouts knots. Soon, it was 12pm and Carter arrived just in time for lunch which was grilled cheese. After cleaning our plates of bread crumbs and cleaning up, we all just talked and socialized with one another.  So after the heat wave passed, Mr Dato suggested that we all head to the camp store to get some ice cream. Then we cooked out dinner which was beef tacos which were great, but the tri tip Mr.Dato cooked was phenomenal. We then shared a moment around the campfire playing telephone and having a good time, but soon we had to pack it up. After brushing our teeth and getting tucked into sleeping bags, we hit the sack.</span>
      <span class="description-span">Waking up with groggily eyes and to the freezing cold, the scouts began to take down their tents and the flagpole. We also had very nice neighbors who dropped off sweets for us. But after we finished packing everything, it was time for roses, thorns and buds. We all got to say out favorite parts, least favorite and something we would do next time. This was an amazing campout and always will be one of the best parts of scouting.</span>
